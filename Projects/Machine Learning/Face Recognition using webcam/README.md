In this project we will recognize our own face using laptop webcam. This code is written in python which can be run using command prompt.

Face recognition is a technique for verifying or identifying a person's identity by analysing and connecting patterns based on the person's facial characteristics, however it is only useful in circumstances when the person's identity is at risk. Face detection is a technique for detecting a person's face in a photograph or video. It's all part of the Object detection process. Face detection might be considered the initial stage in the Face Recognition process. A Deep Face Recognition system with a face detector and alignment is being developed.

# Requirement
Please install following packages 
- numpy= 1.11.0

- matplotlib

# How to RUN
1. Download the data files for the required model. Extract and place it in the data folder.
2. Create a new virtual environment

using conda: 
```
>>> conda create -n <env-name>
```
using pip
```
>>> python -m pip install --user virtualenv
```
4. Install the required packages using the requirements.txt file with the following command
