# NLP Roadmaps


## 1. Starts with basics 
    
There are so many starting points for ML with NLP to start up with but most preffered one is to understand Deep learning and neural networks first and learn how neural layers have been created.

```
RNN , CNN and Recursive models
```

## 2. Task to start with

You can try following task to start u with like 

```
POS Tagging, Parsing, Named Entity Recognition and other mentioned in image.
```

After doing this task you will be able to understand what NLP deals with and its applications.

## 3. Learn representations of words 

Learning word representations will help you understand how the embeddings work for classification and feature representations. There are many models for word embeddings like Word2Vec, Glove and FastText.

## 4. Language Models 

Once you have basic knowledge of how NLP works and how features from words extracted. Now you can start language models here you will learn how language semantics are learnt by models and how translation from one language to other language. Following are the models 


```
Seq2Seq , Attention based mechanism, Transformers etc.
```

## 5. Contextual Word Representations:

Once you are done language models you can also use contextual word representation so that you can be able to understand how State of the art models works for better translations and query.
