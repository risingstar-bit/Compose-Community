Linear Search is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until the desired element is found, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data set. It is the easiest searching algorithm.

#Algorithm

1. Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[]
2. If x matches with an element, return the index.
3. If x doesnâ€™t match with any of the elements, return -1.

#Time Complexity
Time complexity: O(N)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
